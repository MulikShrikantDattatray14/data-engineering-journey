# Day 1 — Slot 01: SQL Foundations & PNP Practice

**Study date:** November 6, 2026 (Asia/Kolkata)  
**Status:** Interactive lesson started; first question awaiting student attempt  
**Actual start/end and verified focus minutes:** Not recorded  
**Goal:** Rebuild accurate foundations, use independent queries to demonstrate fluency, then revisit the existing PNP SQL 205-question bank without duplicating solutions.

## Lesson 1A — How a SELECT query thinks

### Why it matters to Data Engineering
A Data Engineer uses SQL not merely to display rows, but to select clean records for data transformations, validate incoming batches and build reliable aggregations. A simple filtering mistake can silently include cancelled, null or out-of-range records in a production metric.

### Core concepts to demonstrate
- `SELECT`: choose output columns; `FROM`: choose a table or relation.
- `WHERE`: keep rows satisfying a condition. Understand `=`, `<>`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`.
- Boolean logic: `AND` requires both conditions, `OR` either condition; use parentheses to make mixed conditions explicit.
- SQL `NULL` represents an absent/unknown value, not a normal value you can compare with `=`. `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` are the appropriate checks.
- SQL filtering uses three-valued logic: TRUE, FALSE, UNKNOWN. A `WHERE` clause retains only TRUE.
- `ORDER BY` controls sort order; `LIMIT` (PostgreSQL) limits returned rows. A relational result is not guaranteed to have a particular order without explicit ordering.
- We will revisit joins, aggregation, duplicate amplification and multi-concept SQL after these foundations are validated.

### Dialect for this practice
Use **PostgreSQL** syntax in the interactive lesson, so examples and LIMIT/NULL behavior are unambiguous. We can compare SQL Server TOP and other dialects separately later.

## First independent diagnostic: Q1 — Paid Maharashtra orders

You are given an `orders` table:

| order_id | customer_id | status | amount | state |
|---:|---:|---|---:|---|
| 101 | 1 | paid | 1200 | Maharashtra |
| 102 | 2 | paid | 500 | Karnataka |
| 103 | 3 | cancelled | 2200 | Maharashtra |
| 104 | 1 | paid | NULL | Maharashtra |
| 105 | 4 | paid | 1800 | Maharashtra |
| 106 | 5 | pending | 2600 | Maharashtra |

**Your task:** Write one PostgreSQL query returning only `order_id` and `amount` for rows whose `status` is `'paid'`, `state` is `'Maharashtra'`, and `amount` is strictly greater than `1000`. Sort by `amount` descending. Do not hardcode order IDs or answers. Explain why a missing amount must not be included.

**Student attempt:** Pending.  
**Assistant review/corrections:** Pending (withheld until learner replies).  
**Completion credit:** None.

## Remaining Slot 1 sequence (not yet studied)
1. Q1 and two variants to check `AND`/`OR`, operator precedence, `IS NULL`, and sorting.
2. Short diagnostic on joins and multiplicative duplicates.
3. Reattempt 6–10 selected previously solved PNP SQL questions. Original source questions stay in [Repository 2](https://github.com/MulikShrikantDattatray14/Data-Engineering-Mastry).
4. If rapid and accurate, begin pending PNP IDs `A016`, `P009`, `P013`, `P014`. No new IDs are credited before actual review.

## Progress and revision log
- Actual focused minutes: Unverified
- First attempted query: Pending
- SQL source IDs verified today: None
- Errors and important insights: Pending
- Next revision: Pending

**Rule:** Log each original student submission before corrections. Lesson documentation does not equal reviewed mastery.
